# High-performance ticket reservation system for ultra-large-scale events

Managing an **instantaneous, massive surge of traffic** the moment registration opens, while ensuring **fairness, consistency, performance** (predictable, fast response) and **user-friendly** experience.

In this document I am going to take into consideration UX, architectural, data model, backend and frontend related design decisions.

*Note: This is not a full system/architectural design. I will only discuss critical components related to the most challenging nature of such system: mixture of high performance, great UX, fairness under extreme load.*
